# __init__ should initialize a cookie jar with the given capacity, which represents the maximum number of cookies that can fit in
# the cookie jar. If capacity is not a non-negative int, though, __init__ should instead raise a ValueError.
# __str__ should return a str with 𝑛 🍪, where 𝑛 is the number of cookies in the cookie jar. For instance, if there are 3 cookies
# in the cookie jar, then str should return "🍪🍪🍪"
# deposit should add n cookies to the cookie jar. If adding that many would exceed the cookie jar’s capacity, though, deposit
# should instead raise a ValueError.
# withdraw should remove n cookies from the cookie jar. Nom nom nom. If there aren’t that many cookies in the cookie jar, though,
# withdraw should instead raise a ValueError.
# capacity should return the cookie jar’s capacity.
# size should return the number of cookies actually in the cookie jar, initially 0.
